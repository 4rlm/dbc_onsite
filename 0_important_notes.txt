##### Order of Operations #####
1. open github to search old code
2. add desktop 0_challenges into atom (cmd, shft, f)
3. pseudocode
4. read directions carefully, no gold plating.
5. run rspec in the terminal
6. read error in terminal
7. find line in rspec
8. identify correct class and method in rspec.
9. locate same method in .rb, and add a few 'pry', or create method if doesn't exist.
10. fix in the rb. (check if method exists. if not create one!)

## Where to put 'binding.pry' ##
When method exists...
****** binding.pry (anywhere inside method)
1. def method_name
>>>>>> binding.pry
    some code.....
>>>>>> binding.pry
    some code.....
    5 + 2
>>>>>> binding.pry (DO NOT PUT right before end. because it affects return value.)
  end

*** Put binding.pry here..
1) in .rb:
  inside method

2) in Rspec:
  it "..." do
    binding.pry
  end

## Limited Error Reporting ##
1. run test with -e "...."
e.g. $ rspec spec/test_spec.rb -e 'blah blah'

## Use pry (NOT irb)!!!
