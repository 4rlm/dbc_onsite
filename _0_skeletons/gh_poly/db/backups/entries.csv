3,Tony Smith,Gardening Tips,"1. If its getting cold and you have tomatoes still ripening on the vine — save your tomatoes! Pull the plants up and bring them inside to a warm dry place. Hang them up, and the tomatoes will ripen on the vine.

2. Companion planting is an excellent way to improve your garden. Some plants replenish nutrients lost by another one, and some combinations effectively keep pests away.

3. Paint the handles of your gardens tools a bright, color other than green to help you find them amongst your plants. You can also keep a mailbox in your garden for easy tool storage.

4. Compost needs time to integrate and stabilize in the soil. Apply two to three weeks prior to planting.

5. There is an easy way to mix compost into your soil without a lot of back breaking work: Spread the compost over your garden in the late fall, after all the harvesting is done. Cover with a winter mulch such as hay or chopped leaves and let nature take its course. By spring, the melting snow and soil organisms will have worked the compost in for you.",2017-07-25 17:56:08 UTC,2017-07-25 17:56:08 UTC
4,Mary Moore,"History of Austin, Texas","By 1836 the Texas Revolution was over and the Republic of Texas was independent. That year was also characterized by political disarray in Texas. In 1836, no fewer than five Texas sites served as temporary capitals of the new republic (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia), before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837.[10]

Shortly after the election of President Mirabeau B. Lamar, the Texas Congress appointed a site-selection commission to locate an optimal site for a new permanent capital. They chose a site on the western frontier, after viewing it at the instruction of President Lamar, who visited the sparsely settled area in 1838. Lamar was a proponent of westward expansion. Impressed by its beauty, abundant natural resources, promise as an economic hub, and central location in Texas territory, the commission purchased 7,735 acres (3,130 ha) along the Colorado River comprising the hamlet of Waterloo and adjacent lands.[11]

Because the area's remoteness from population centers and its vulnerability to attacks by Mexican troops and Native Americans displeased many Texans, Sam Houston among them, political opposition made Austin's early years precarious ones. However, Lamar prevailed in his nomination, which he felt would be a prime location that intersected the roads to San Antonio and Santa Fe.[12]

Officially chartered in 1839, the Texas Congress designated the name of Austin for the new city. According to local folklore, Stephen F. Austin, the ""father of Texas"" for whom the new capital city was named, negotiated a boundary treaty with the local Native Americans at the site of the present-day Treaty Oak after a few settlers were killed in raids.[13] After the republic purchased several hundred acres to establish the city, Lamar renamed it in honor of Stephen F. Austin in March 1839. The city's original name is honored by local businesses such as Waterloo Ice House and Waterloo Records, as well as Waterloo Park downtown.[14]

Lamar tapped Judge Edwin Waller to direct the planning and construction of the new town. Waller chose a 640-acre (260 ha) site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek to the west and Waller Creek (which was named for him) to the east. Waller surveyed a grid plan on a single square-mile plot with 14 blocks running in both directions. One grand avenue, which Lamar named ""Congress"", cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north-south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east-west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers. (They were eventually changed to numbers in 1884.) The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now Interstate 35) to West Avenue.[15] Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.

In October 1839, the entire government of the Republic of Texas arrived by oxcart from Houston. By the next January, the population of the town was 839. During the Republic of Texas era, France sent Alphonse Dubois de Saligny to Austin as its chargé d'affaires. Dubois purchased 22 acres (8.9 ha) of land in 1840 on a high hill just east of downtown to build a legation, or diplomatic outpost. The French Legation stands as the oldest documented frame structure in Austin.[16] Also in 1839, the Texas Congress set aside 40 acres (16 ha) of land north of the capitol and downtown for a ""university of the first class."" This land became the central campus of the University of Texas at Austin in 1883.[17]

7,Carol Meijer,Hummingbirds in the Texas Hill Country,"Throughout the world, there are 320 species of hummingbirds, 18 of which can be found in America. In the state of Texas, this number drops to nine particular species, and in the Texas Hill Country specifically, there are five known frequenters and three rovers. Birdwatchers of the Hill Country report the likes of buff-bellied, Lucifer, green violet-ear, rufous, broad-tailed, Anna’s, broad-billed, and black-chinned. It sounds more like a mish-mash of ruffians than delicate hummingbirds, but the excitement they create in the birdwatching community is akin to finding a $20-bill in your coat pocket.

After leaving their southern migration areas, hummingbirds will traditionally reach the Texas Hill Country from mid-March to mid-May. Breeding begins in early April and continues through to early September, and they’ve been known to still be feeding their young as late as the beginning of that same month. Outside of some city settings, they breed near flowering meadows and woodlands, and the presence of a feeder has been known to draw them to nest close by.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) completes an annual Texas Hummingbird Roundup Backyard survey, calling on Lone Star State bird lovers to participate through tracking local sightings. Receiving a package normally containing a survey sheet, hummingbird feeder maintenance tips, and a Quick Reference Guide to Texas Hummingbirds booklet for easy recognition of characteristics, those that complete the survey help to provide information on hummingbird-favored sites and feeding habits. In turn, this information helps TPWD to improve conservation as well as effectively track the Texas hummingbird population.

If you’re looking but haven’t seen these sometimes-elusive little creatures, the purchase and set-up of a proper feeder are sure to attract a regular visitor. Hummingbirds want a consistent supply of nectar. They also want it to be mold-free, so practice systematic cleaning of your feeders to maintain their visits. If you start to find that multiple birds are appearing, this is your indication to obtain more feeders and place them a fair space apart. These birds may seem small but their fiery, and competition for food can often get fierce. Aside from changing the nectar twice weekly, you simply need to be present and still to watch as a hummingbird takes advantage of your feeder offer and makes regular visits to your own Texas Hill Country backyard.",2017-07-25 18:11:18 UTC,2017-07-25 18:11:18 UTC
8,Lisa Prisco,About Austin Texas,"The city has a heavy concentration of highly-educated millennials. Austin is home to the headquarters for many technology corporations, adopting the nickname Silicon Hills in the 1990s. Recently, however, the current official slogan promotes Austin as The Live Music Capital of the World, a reference to the many musicians and live music venues within the area. One major event, South by Southwest, is one of the largest music festivals in the U.S., with more than 2,000 performers playing on more than 100 stages around Downtown Austin over four days every March. The event has grown into a 10-day festival celebrating film, music and digital media. Austin is home to the University of Texas at Austin, the flagship institution of the University of Texas System.",2017-07-25 18:58:17 UTC,2017-07-25 18:58:17 UTC
9,Billy Townsend,"Music of Austin, Texas","Music of Austin, Texas: Austin's official motto is the ""Live Music Capital of the World"" because on any given night, one can find over one hundred venues showcasing a wide variety of affordable - or free - live music performances. Austin is also famed for the SXSW and the Austin City Limits (ACL) Music Festivals which showcase an eclectic array of live musical talent from across the globe. The greatest concentration of music venues in Austin are located around 6th Street, the Warehouse District, Downtown, Central East Austin, South Congress, the Red River District, the University of Texas, South Lamar, and South Austin.

The modern definition of ""Austin music"" emerged in 1972 when ""a new form of country music exploded on the scene that turned its back on Nashville and embraced the counterculture."".[1]Eddie Wilson had opened the Armadillo World Headquarters music venue in 1970, which drew large crowds to alternating country and rock music shows.[2] But it was 1972 when a minimally successful Willie Nelson left Nashville once and for all and moved to Austin, joining several other talented nonconformists and recent transplants including Michael (Martin) Murphy, Marcia Ball, Steve Earle, Gary P. Nunn, Jerry Jeff Walker, Ray Wiley Hubbard, Waylon Jennings and others. Willie grew his hair long and ""figured out how to bring the hippies and the rednecks together."" His audiences at the Armadillo began to cross-pollinate and ""what resulted was a scene that no one had ever seen before[3]....On New Year’s Eve, Austin’s local KOKE.FM radio station switched to a new format geared to the mixed crowds first called “country rock,” and later “progressive country.” By November of that year, the first pilot for the iconic Austin City Limits was being filmed with Willie....Billboard Magazine named KOKE “the most innovative radio station in the country;"" and Austin had a national reputation thanks largely to the reporting of Rolling Stone stringer Chet Flippo, who seemed to get a dispatch from the Armadillo into every issue.""[4]

Austin became renowned for nurturing talented musicians who didn’t fit the mold anywhere else and were drawn in by the creative vibe, liberal politics, and the low cost-of-living in what was then a laid back Capital city whose largest employers were the University of Texas and State government. Austin's reputation continued to grow and become celebrated for its folk, blues, jazz, bluegrass, tejano, zydeco, new wave, punk, and indie music scenes.

The City also supports two orchestras: the Austin Symphony and Austin Civic Orchestras, as well as the Austin Opera.",2017-07-25 22:17:20 UTC,2017-07-25 22:17:20 UTC
10,Sammy O'Ryan,Austin Wildlife Rescue,"You found a wild animal, what is the next step?
 
Many well-meaning people rescue an orphaned mammal or bird that does not need to be rescued.

DO NOT rescue a wild animal and keep (kidnap) it as a possible pet. State and federal laws protect nearly all wild mammals and birds. It is against the law to possess the animal or bird or the nests, feathers, or eggs of a bird without special permits.

In addition, dietary needs of each species are different and it is almost impossible to duplicate their needs in captivity without special training. Rehabilitators often receive irreparably damaged animals because the rescuer tried to keep it as a pet and did not know how to provide for it properly.
 
It is not true that mammals or birds will always reject their young once they have been handled by humans.

Nonetheless, the handling of wild babies should be avoided or kept to a minimum. Handling by humans can be stressful to the animal. Also, the human scent can sometimes attract predators seeking food.",2017-07-25 22:37:08 UTC,2017-07-25 22:37:08 UTC

12,Scott Weidenar,Mountain Biking,"Mountain biking is the sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into multiple categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as ""Enduro""), downhill, freeride and dirt jumping. However, the majority of mountain biking falls into the categories of Trail and Cross Country riding styles.

The sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeriding, downhilling, and dirt jumping, aerial manoeuvres are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.

Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, and fire roads. Because riders are often far from civilization, there is a strong ethic of self-reliance in the sport. Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded. Many riders carry a backpack, including water, food, tools for trailside repairs, and a first aid kit in case of injury. Group rides are common, especially on longer treks. Mountain bike orienteering adds the skill of map navigation to mountain biking.",2017-07-25 22:43:02 UTC,2017-07-25 22:43:02 UTC
13,Joaquin Phoenix,Transitioning to a Vegan Lifestyle,"So you’ve decided that you’d like to become vegan, but where do you start? Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can seem really daunting but often the idea of a big lifestyle change is a lot scarier than actually doing it. If you focus on making one change at a time the progression to veganism will feel quite natural. It’s important to go at your own pace and to decide on a method that works best for you. Here are some ideas and guidelines to structure your transition to veganism, just be sure to tailor them to your specific needs.

LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

Before you even begin the transition the first step is to start familiarizing yourself with veganism. This will really help you feel prepared and knowledgeable as you begin changing your lifestyle.

Learn the benefits of a vegan lifestyle and educate yourself about the practices and costs behind the production of animal products. Find your own personal reasons for being vegan, there’s loads of them.
Learn how to optimally nourish your body on a plant-based diet.
Start reading ingredients lists – Learn how to tell if a product is vegan and familiarize yourself with the less obvious animal derived ingredients that show up in unsuspecting products.
Be on the lookout for vegan products at your local grocery store, research vegan friendly restaurants and grocery stores in your area.
Read, watch, learn. Seek out vegan documentaries, books, magazines, websites, blogs, forums, and people. They can offer valuable insights, support, and will help you to feel more confident in your transition.
