1. Environment Configuration
* configuration of our application is done in the file config/environment.rb
* Pathname and Dir classes and the configuration of ApplicationRecord to connect with the database.


2. Rakefile
* Helpful tasks to get our application up and running.

$ bundle exec rake -T
Listing available Rake tasks.

$ rake console
Opens IRB with our application's environment loaded: the models are available, the connection with the database is established, etc

$ rake spec
Runs all of the spec files in our application (i.e., run the tests).

$ rake db:taskname
Related to database.  Replace 'taskname' with ... create, drop, migrate, rollback, seed, and version

$ rake generate:taskname
creating or generating files: model for creating files for Active Record models, migration for creating files for updating our database, and spec for creating test files for our models.


2. Model-view-controller Organization
Ex. app/models
* Each class should be defined in its own file.
# Ex. Dog class in app/models/dog.rb




3. Database
Ex. db/ (Ex. SQLite3 database)
* migrations that help to build our database schema (e.g., creating tables).
* db/migrate folder: one migration for each change to the database schema


4. Organizing Test Files
Ex. spec/schema/dogs_table_spec.rb

5. Specifying Gems
* Gemfile and Gemfile.lock

####### Process ############
1. Installing Gems
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install


2. Create the Database
$ bundle exec rake db:create


3. Check Database Version
$ bundle exec rake db:version


4. Run the Test Suite
$ bundle exec rake spec

5. Run the Migrations
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate

6. Check Database Version
$ bundle exec rake db:version

7. Run the Test Suite
- Should pass.

8. Populate the Database with Seed Data
$ bundle exec rake db:seed

9. Open and Use the Console
$ bundle exec rake console
ex:
ApplicationRecord.connection.tables
ApplicationRecord.connection.columns(:dogs)
Dog
Dog.all / (Dog::all) / class method / (SELECT "dogs".* FROM "dogs")
exit

10. Rollback the Database
$ bundle exec rake db:rollback

11. Drop the Database
$ bundle exec rake db:drop
